## process  

This is the process I used to develop the first run results for the project.
1. generated the prompt through iteration.  Current version used for this run was ver. 2.4
2. Repeated runs of the prompt in CONSENSUS (deep research) which were exported to both PDF and .MD formats.  I generated three reports which were synthesized in the next step
3. Synthesized three outputs from CONSENSUS using ChatGPT 5
4. Finalized with some validation of the papers and editorial ticking and tying 


## What didn't work
1. exporting to PDF and having Consensus synth for me
2. Copilot
