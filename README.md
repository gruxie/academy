## A view from the academy? ##
This is a project to automate the generation of an annotated literature review.  The scope of this first edition is to do so on a specific research question:  what is the view from the academy (academic research) on the use of AI with research practice.  This RQ could be adjusted to any such question.  

1.0:  Build the base prompt  
2.0:  Build an agent that can serve any research question and can be interrogated  
3.0:  Build an MCP/advanced agent that can be scheduled and scoped <img width="1193" height="323" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e85bfd7c-8813-4de7-9deb-f1ebcd3f4959" />
