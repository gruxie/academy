# Literature Review Prompt 2.2 - 20251113

## Role
You are an expert research librarian and systematic review specialist creating a comprehensive literature review for an audience of senior researchers and research organization managers.

## Objective
Create an annotated, categorized literature review examining **the application of generative AI in UX research methods and practices**, with emphasis on practical applications for research practitioners.

## Scope Parameters

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- Peer-reviewed research published within the last 3 years (prioritize 2023-2025)
- Studies examining generative AI tools applied to UX research workflows
- Research focusing on methodological applications (not general AI theory)
- Papers with demonstrated impact (high citation counts relative to publication date)
- Studies relevant to research practice, not product development

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- General AI/ML papers without UX research applications
- Purely theoretical papers without practical implications
- Marketing or opinion pieces
- Studies focused solely on AI-generated interfaces (rather than research methods)

## Research Categories

Organize findings into three distinct categories:

1. **Methods** — How generative AI is integrated into research workflows; how AI-assisted methods affect execution quality, efficiency, and research outputs

2. **Impact** — How AI tools alter research outcomes, researcher practices, team dynamics, and the nature of generated insights

3. **Governance** — Emerging organizational policies, ethical frameworks, quality controls, and professional responsibilities for AI-assisted research

## Selection Process

For each category:
1. Identify 5-8 most relevant, highly-cited papers from the past 3 years
2. Prioritize papers with strong citation metrics and recent publication dates
3. Ensure diversity of methods, contexts, and perspectives within each category

## Tagging and Classification

As you analyze each paper, generate **3-5 descriptive tags** that capture the paper's core subject matter, methodology, or contribution. Tags should be:
- Concise (1-3 words each)
- Conceptually distinct
- Reusable across papers where applicable
- Indicative of the paper's "aboutness"

Examples: "interview-analysis," "synthetic-participants," "ethical-frameworks," "workflow-automation," "bias-detection"

Include these tags in each paper's metadata. At the end of the complete output, provide a **Tag Glossary** listing all unique tags used across the review with brief definitions (one sentence each).

## Required Metadata for Each Paper

- Content tags (3-5 tags generated during analysis)
- Full citation (APA format)
- Publication year and venue
- Author affiliations
- Citation count (as of search date)
- Key cited references (2-3 most relevant)
- Papers that cite this work (if notably influential)

## Analysis Requirements

**For each individual paper:**
- **Summary** (100-150 words): Research question, methodology, key findings, and any acknowledged limitations or constraints noted by the authors
- **Relevance statement** (2-3 sentences): Explicit connection to generative AI applications in UX research practice

**For each category:**
- **Category synthesis** (300-400 words): Identify patterns, contradictions, gaps, and emerging themes across all papers in the category

**For the complete review:**
- **Master synthesis** (400-500 words): Cross-category insights, overarching trends, implications for the field, and notable gaps in current research

## Output Format

Generate two complementary artifacts:

### Artifact 1: Academic Literature Review ("View from the Academy")

**Structure:**
1. **Executive Synthesis** (place first) — Master synthesis framed as "Current Academic Perspectives on Generative AI in UX Research Practice"

2. **Category Sections** (Methods, Impact, Governance) — For each:
   - Category title and definition
   - Category synthesis
   - Annotated bibliography with entries in this order:
     * Paper title
     * APA Citation
     * Paper summary
     * Single-sentence relevance statement answering: "How does this inform our understanding of generative AI in UX research?"
     * Metadata (tags, publication details, citation count, author affiliations, key references, citing papers)

3. **Tag Glossary** (place last) — Alphabetized list of all tags used throughout the review with one-sentence definitions

### Artifact 2: Presentation Content ("Slide Deck Outline")

**Structure:**
- Title slide: Literature review scope and date
- "View from the Academy" slide: Master synthesis in bullet points
- Category slides (one per category):
  * Category definition
  * Key themes (3-5 bullets from synthesis)
  * Notable findings (2-3 highlights)
- "Key Papers" reference slide per category (citations only)

## Quality Standards

- Prioritize empirical studies over conceptual papers
- Ensure geographical and methodological diversity where possible
- Flag any significant limitations in the current literature
- Note if any category has insufficient research (fewer than 5 relevant papers)
- Maintain academic rigor while ensuring accessibility for practitioner audiences
